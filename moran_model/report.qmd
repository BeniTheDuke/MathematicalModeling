# The Moran model: Fixation time of beneficial alleles in populations of constant size
*(1) Formally define the Moran model of population dynamics with selection. List model’s assumptions. What is the probability of fixation of an allele, how does it depend on allele fitness? Write a program to simulate a population with selection.*

```{python}
from moran import MoranModel

SEED = 42

moran_model = MoranModel(100, 50, 1, 1, SEED)
for i in range(1,10):
    print(moran_model.run_until_absorption())


```
